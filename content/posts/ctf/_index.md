## CTFs Writeups

In here I post the writeups of my favourites CTF challenges that I manage to solve.\
As of now, my main goal is to verticalize my skills on the **Web Security** sector, as part of my affort to maybe, one day, join [TeamItaly](https://teamitaly.it). Because of this goal of mine, i _will not_ share writeups of challenges which I solved together with the team of _srdnlen_, as those are always a result of great group effort, rather than of a single person.

My main platforms for training in CTFs are:
1. [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/884312) (_mainly for challenges_)
2. [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/justlel) (_mainly for machines_)
3. [OliCyber](https://training.olicyber.it) (_to train on challenges very similar to those of the CyberChallenge finals_)
4. [CyberChallenge](https://ctf.cyberchallenge.it)
